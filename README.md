## Background

South Side Weekly (SSW) is a nonprofit newspaper dedicated to supporting cultural and civic engagement on the South Side of Chicago, as well as developing emerging journalists, writers, and artists. The Weekly covers a range of topics, including politics, the arts, public interest issues, as well as poetry, fiction, and local artwork.

The majority of The Weekly's staff are volunteers, with their main contributor base coming from their readers themselves. SSW is is currently in need of a volunteer hub that can streamline the onboarding process and help volunteers and staff keep track of pitches, assignments, and contributions.
